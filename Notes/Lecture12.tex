  \item Contingency Analysis (Lab 6)

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Bus load for the next hour $\to$ $P_{Dk},Q_{Dk}$ ($PQ$ Buses)

      \item Scheduled generation for the next hour $\to$ $P_{Gk},Q_{Gk}$ ($PV$ Buses)

      \item Run PF $\to$ $V_k,\theta_k$ for $k=1,\cdots,n$

      \item Compute the line flows $P_f$ for all lines in the system

      \item Check if $|P_{fk}|<$ limits, and $|V_{k}|<$ limits for all lines and buses

      \item Contingencies: line, generator, load outages

      \item Run PF for each contingency (return to step 4 and keep repeating)

    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Note that every generator has a maximum and minimum reactive power limit

      \item We once again use the Newton-Raphsson method to solve:

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Assume $X^o=[\hat{\theta},V]^T$ and $\theta=0,V=1[p.u.]$

          \item $\Delta P=P(X)-P^{sch}$ for all buses but slack bus, and $\Delta Q=Q(x)-Q^{sch}$ for $PQ$ buses ($n_{PQ}$)

          \item We compute the Jacobian:

            $$J(X)=\frac{\partial F}{\partial X},\quad X^{k+1}=X^k-[J]^{-1}F(X^k)$$

          \item $Q_G(X^{k+1}):$ if $Q_{Gi}(X^{k+1)}$ violates its $Q$ limits, then convert bus $i$ from $PV$ to $PQ$-type and set its reactive power to the violated limit

        \end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Steps of Fast Decoupled Load Flow (special case of Newton-Raphsson, provides faster solution):

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Build $B'$, $B''$ (factorize $B'=L_1U_1$ and $B''=L_2U_2$); Initialize $V_i=1[p.u.],\theta_i=0$ if $i$ is not a slack bus or $PV$ bus. We get $P_{flag}=0;Q_{flag}=0$

      \item Compute $\Delta P/V\to \Delta P_k/V_k=(P_k(X)-P_k^{sch})/V_k$ with $k=1,2,\cdots,n$; Set $P_{flag}=1$ if $||\Delta P||<\varepsilon=10^{-4}$; stop if $Q_{flag}=1$ and $P_{flag}=1$

      \item $L_1U_1\Delta \theta=[\Delta P/V]\to$ For/back substitution ($\theta\Leftarrow \theta+\Delta \theta$)

      \item Compute [$\Delta Q/V$]$\to \Delta Q_k/V_k=(Q_k(X)-Q_k^{sch})/V_k$, for $k:n_{PQ}$ to keep the $PQ$ buses; Set $Q_{flag}=1$ if $||\Delta Q||<\varepsilon=10^{-4}$; stop if $P_{flag}=1$ and $Q_{flag}=1$

      \item $L_2U_2\Delta V=[\Delta Q/V]\to$ For/back substitution ($V\Leftarrow V+\Delta V$)

    \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
