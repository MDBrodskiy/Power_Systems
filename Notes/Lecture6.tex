\begin{itemize}

  \item Considering a network consisting of a generator, connected to a transmission network, with a distribution network:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The distribution network is generally low (or lower) voltage area

      \item Distribution networks are generally connected by voltage drop-down transformers

      \item Regulators are implemented â€” essentially transformers with really small turn radii

        $$\alpha\cong 10-100$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $\alpha$ is the turns ratio

        \end{itemize}

      \item For a regulator, we may write:

        $$V_{a'n}=V_{an}+\Delta V_{an}$$

      \item There will be a slight phase offset, which may be written as:

        $$\hat{V}_2=\hat{a}\hat{V}_1=\hat{V}_1e^{j\phi}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where the exponential term is called a ``phase shifter''

        \end{itemize}

      \item A phase shifter may be drawn as follows:

          \caption{Phase Shifter Schematic}
          \label{fig:1}
        \end{figure}

      \item Dots added to transformer diagrams indicate that certain points are at the same phase, and show orientations of windings

      \item Phase shift is determined by turns ratio $\to$ small turns ratio, small shift, and vice versa (usually at most a few degrees)

      \item Note that the turns ratio acts as a ``valve'' which can switch reactive power flow from one transformer to the next (for regulators)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Higher turns in the second transformer would result in higher reactive power

        \end{itemize}

      \item The same ``valve'' logic applies to phase shifters; however, instead of affecting the reactive power this affects real power

      \item In summary: Phase shifter used to change phase and modify real power flow, while regulators modify reactive power flow

    \end{itemize}

  \item Nominal Tap Transformer:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Modeled by:

        $$\left[ \begin{matrix} i_k\\i_m\end{matrix} \right]=\left[ \begin{matrix} y_t & -y_t\\ -y_t & y_t\end{matrix} \right]\left[\begin{matrix} V_k\\V_m \end{matrix}\right]$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where:

            $$y_t=\frac{1}{r+jx_t}$$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Off-Nominal Tap Transformer:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Modeled by:

        $$\left[ \begin{matrix} I_1\\I_2\end{matrix} \right]=\left[ \begin{matrix} y_t/a^2 & -y_t/a\\ -y_t/a & y_t\end{matrix} \right]\left[\begin{matrix} V_1\\V_2 \end{matrix}\right]$$

      \item Note that, by setting $a\to 1$, we are essentially returning to a nominal tap transformer, as the regulator component is eliminated

      \item Can be thought of as a regulating transformer equivalent circuit in per-unit

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
