\begin{itemize}

  \item Transformers

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A device which has two coils, a primary and secondary, both of which are physically wrapped around a magnetic rectangular donut-like shape

      \item The magnetic material traps the flux generated by pushing a current through the primary coil

      \item Some flux will ``leak'' into the empty central portion of the shape from both coils, called the ``leakage flux''

      \item Given $N_1$ turns on the primary coil and $N_2$ turns on the secondary coil, the total flux becomes:

        $$N_1\phi=\lambda_1$$
        $$N_2\phi=\lambda_2$$

        $$N_1\frac{d\phi}{dt}=V_1$$
        $$N_2\frac{d\phi}{dt}=V_2$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item With $\phi$ as the flux through one turn, and $\lambda_n$ as the total flux through the coil

        \end{itemize}

      \item This gives us a voltage ratio:

        $$\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\frac{N_1}{N_2}$$

      \item Thus, transformers are used to step the voltage up/down

      \item In the case that there is no leakage flux (an ideal transformer), the powers are equal: $V_1i_1=V_2i_2$

        $$\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\frac{N_1}{N_2}=\frac{i_2}{i_1}$$

      \item Expressing in matrix notation, we may write:

        $$\left[ \begin{matrix} V_1\\i_1 \end{matrix} \right]=\left[ \begin{matrix} n & 0\\ 0 & \frac{1}{n} \end{matrix}\right]\left[ \begin{matrix} V_2\\ i_2\end{matrix} \right]$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item With $n=\dfrac{N_1}{N_2}$

        \end{itemize}

      \item To support the model, a ``magnetizing inductor'' (which is non-existent) may be introduced to derive the actual load current

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $i_{\phi}$ is the excitation current, which is typically 1-3\% of the load current

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Per-Unit System

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Per-unit value of a quantity (could be a voltage, a current, impedance, power, etc.) is the actual value divided by the base value

      \item Step 1

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Choose the base value for 2 out of many variables

        \end{itemize}

      \item Step 2

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Determine the base values for all remaining variables

        \end{itemize}

      \item For a change of base in a transformer, we may write:

        $$x_{pu2}=x_{pu1}\left( \frac{V_{b1}}{V_{b2}} \right)^{2}\left( \frac{S_{b2}}{S_{b1}} \right)$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
