\begin{itemize}

  \item Total Transfer Capability (TTC) Computation

    \begin{itemize}

      \item With a source and sink bus (with load $P_L$), slowly increase the load $P_L$

    \end{itemize}

  \item DC Power Approximation:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item From the power flow equation, we get:

        $$P_{km}=\frac{\theta_k-\theta_m}{X}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item This is a linear approximation for the DC power flow

        \end{itemize}

      \item Let us assume that there are $L$ lines in a system and $n$ buses. Then, define the line-to-bus incidence matrix $A$ as follows:

        $$A(i,j)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 1,&\text{if $j$ is the sending-end of line $i$}\\ -1,&\text{if $j$ is the receiving-end of line $i$}\\0,&\text{Otherwise}\end{array}$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
