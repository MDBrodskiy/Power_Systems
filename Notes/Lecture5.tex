  \item 3-Phase Transformer Bank

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Consists of phases $A, B$, and $C$, each connected to a terminal, which outputs phase $a, b,$ and $c$ at a different voltage

      \item Inside the ``black box'' there are transformers corresponding to each phase, but we are more interested in what occurs at the terminals

    \end{itemize}

  \item With two buses injecting current towards each other, we may derive some equations:

    $$\hat{z}=z\angle\theta_z$$
    $$S_{12}=(V_1\angle\theta_1)(\hat{I}_{12}^*)\quad\text{ and }\quad S_{21}=(V_2\angle\theta_2)(\hat{I}_{21}^*)$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item This gives us:

        $$S_{12}=\frac{V_1^2}{z}e^{j\theta_z}-\frac{V_1V_2}{z}e^{j\theta_z}e^{j\theta_{12}}$$
        $$S_{12}=C_1-Be^{j\theta_{12}}$$
        $$-S_{21}=-\frac{V_2^2}{z}e^{j\theta_z}+\frac{V_1V_2}{z}e^{j\theta_z}e^{-j\theta_{12}}$$
        $$-S_{21}=C_2+Be^{-j\theta_{12}}$$

      \item These equations allow us to form ``power circle'' graphs to more easily demonstrate how power is delivered from one side of a transmission line to the other

      \item Real power travels long distances better than reactive power

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
