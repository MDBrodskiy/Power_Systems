\begin{enumerate}

  \item Read data: Bus data, branch data

  \item Form $Y_{bus}=G+jB$

  \item Initialize $k=0$:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Let:

        $$V_i=1[p.u.]\quad i=n_{PV}+2,\cdots,n\quad\text{ (All $PQ$ Buses)}$$
        $$V_i=V_I^{sch}\quad i=1,2,\cdots,n_{PV}+1\quad\text{ (Slack buses, $PV$ Buses)}$$
        $$B_i=0\quad i=1,2,\cdots,n$$
        $$x^{k}=\left[ \theta_2,\cdots,\theta_n\Big| V_{n_{PV}+2},\cdots,V_{n} \right]$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Calculate bus mismatches:

    $$P_i^{cal}(x^k)-P_i^{sch}=\Delta P_i\quad i=2,3,\cdots,n\text{ ($n-1$ equations)}$$
    $$Q_i^{cal}(x^k)-Q_i^{sch}=\Delta Q_i\quad i=n_{PV}+2,\cdots,n\text{ ($n_{PQ}$ equations)}$$

  \item Build the Jacobian $J$

  \item Take:

    $$x^{k+1}=x^k-[J]^{-1}F(x^k)$$

  \item If $|F(x^{k+1})|<\varepsilon$ (the largest absolute value), stop; otherwise, $k=k+1$ and go to step 4

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Typically use $\varepsilon=10^{-3}\text{ or }10^{-4}[p.u.]$

    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Generator buses have reactive limits, which can be specified as $Q_{min}$ and $Q_{max}$

  \item Slack bus provides difference between total load and total generation, as well as accounts for the system loss (total real power supplied minus the total real power drawn/loaded)

\end{itemize}
