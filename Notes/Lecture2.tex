\begin{itemize}

  \item Capacitors may be connected in parallel to increase power factor

  \item For a balanced three-phase circuit, we may analyze each phase independently

  \item Connections may be in 'Y' or Delta form; for analysis, we prefer 'Y'

  \item To convert from Delta-type connections, we may use the following:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Impedances:

        $$Z_Y=\frac{1}{3}Z_{\Delta}$$

      \item Sources:

        $$\hat{V}_{LL}=\sqrt{3}\hat{V}_{LN}e^{j30^{\circ}}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item To use these analyses methods, we must assume:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The system is 3-phased and balanced

      \item All the loads and sources are 'Y'-connected

      \item No mutual inductance between phases

    \end{itemize}

  \item This then allows us to assume:
    
    \begin{itemize}

      \item All the neutrals will be acting at the same potential

      \item Phases will be completely decoupled

      \item All network variables occur in balanced sets of the same sequence as the sources

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
