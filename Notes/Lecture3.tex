\begin{itemize}

  \item A representation with a single generator labeled 'G' and subsequent loads is referred to as a ``one-line diagram''

  \item Adding a neutral-to-ground impedance is extraneous and may appear as a diversion on a homework or exam problem; these impedances can simply be ignored due to a zero current flow

  \item For a balanced, three-phase circuit, the average power can be written as:

    $$P_{3\phi}(t)=\frac{3}{2}V_mI_m\cos(\phi)$$

    \begin{center}
      or, for RMS values:
    \end{center}

    \vspace{-15pt}

    $$P_{3\phi}(t)=3V_{RMS}I_{RMS}\cos(\phi)$$

  \item The power factor angle is the angle between the line-to-neutral voltage and the line current

  \item The voltage given will always be in line-to-line terms

\end{itemize}
