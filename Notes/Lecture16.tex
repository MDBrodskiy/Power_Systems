\begin{itemize}

  \item Cost of Generation (Formulation and Solution)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Construct the Lagrange Function:

        $$\mathcal{L}=C_T-\lambda f$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $\lambda$ is an unknown (Lagrange) multiplier

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item ED Rule (Simplified)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item All units should have the same incremental cost, $\lambda$

      \item Sum of unit outputs should match the total cost

    \end{itemize}
